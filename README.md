# dotfiles-v2
Version 2 of my dotfiles

## Setup
Dotfile management is based on the [Atlassian Git guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

An autoamted setup Gist is provided [here](https://gist.github.com/guyfleeman/e898f339fc4d20d3fa40840af1577c46). You can pipe this directly into bash with the command below to setup a clean system.

```
wget -O - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/guyfleeman/e898f339fc4d20d3fa40840af1577c46/raw/e738073a842a84d17c4c42afef120ea974afc257/df_setup.sh | bash
```
